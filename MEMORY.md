## Pending / Next Steps

- **Live-verify the redesigned Focus Score** (2026-06-16): run real camera sessions and confirm `focusScore` + `scoreConfidence` are written correctly at both natural-completion and skip paths in the sessions JSON. Scenarios: clean baseline, heavy away-time, phone pickup, rising-blink drift, and a withheld "—" (camera off most of session / <3 blinks). Tunables in `SCORE_CONFIG` may need calibration on real hardware.
- `markitdown` not yet installed. User needs to click "pip install" on the Docs page, or run `pip install markitdown` manually.
- Nature paper (s41598-025-24264-5) is paywalled — couldn't retrieve it. If user shares it, add findings to `theoryLogic.md`.
- User wants Documents page to be for research papers only (not user-facing context docs) — clarify use case if needed.

## Decisions Made

### 2026-06-16 — Focus Score redesign (reliability)
The Focus Score was unreliable: it saved a single **final-minute snapshot** of `computeFocusScore(blinkRate, cv)` at timer-zero and **ignored away-time and phone pickups entirely** (a user could look away or grab their phone repeatedly and still score 100). Redesigned into a two-layer score:
1. **Instantaneous cognitive score** — `computeFocusScore(bpm, cv)` is unchanged (rate 55% + rhythm 45%), still drives the live banner.
2. **Session score** — new `computeSessionScore(...)` in `focusScore.js`: `cognitiveAvg × presenceFactor × phoneFactor × driftFactor`, returns `{ score, confidence }`.
   - `cognitiveAvg` = **time-weighted average** of the cognitive score over on-screen frames (not a snapshot). `useEyeTracker.js` accumulates `cogScoreWeightedSum`/`cogScorePresentMs` + a `cogScoreSamples` buffer (in `eyeTrackerSlice.js`) each face-visible frame; `usePomodoro.js` snapshots them at session start (`snapshotSessionStart`) and diffs at completion (`buildSessionScore`).
   - `presenceFactor = (1 − awayFraction)^1.5` (super-linear — away bites harder).
   - `phoneFactor = 1 − min(pickups × 0.09, 0.40)` (heavier, capped).
   - `driftFactor` = capped (0.15) penalty when the last third of the session scores lower than the first (rising BPM / rising variability = losing focus).
   - **Confidence:** withhold (`score: null`, UI "—") under ~60s on-screen or <3 blinks; `'low'` (faded "~N") under 180s / <8 blinks / awayFraction>0.5; else `'high'`. Low-confidence sessions excluded from Best Focus Hours.
3. **Persistence:** sessions now also store `scoreConfidence`. Legacy sessions (no field) treated as acceptable.
4. **UI:** `SessionsTable` FocusBadge renders "—" / faded "~N"; `StatsPage` Best Focus Hours filters low-confidence.
5. **Docs:** `docs/blinksInfo.md` §3 rewritten as the source of truth for both layers; `EyeDebugPage.jsx` help text updated.

**All tunables live in `SCORE_CONFIG`** (`src/renderer/src/constants/blinksConfig.js`) — one place to adjust penalties/thresholds.
**Deliberate choices (confirmed with user — do NOT "fix" without asking):** app-usage is intentionally NOT in the score (only away + phone); universal A–F brackets kept with **no** per-user blink-baseline personalization.
**Why:** the old score measured only the last 60s of blinking and threw away the behavioural signals it already recorded; time-weighting + presence/phone/drift penalties + a data-sufficiency gate make it represent the whole session.
**Verified:** 9/9 pure-function assertions on `computeSessionScore`; full `electron-vite build` clean. Live camera end-to-end still pending (see Pending).
Gotcha: the per-frame cognitive accumulation must run in the **face-visible branch** of `runFrame` (where `dt` exists) and only when `liveFocusScore != null`; accumulators reset in both `startTracking` and `stopTracking` alongside `blinkCount`.

### 2026-06-12 — Ritual UX overhaul + XLSX export
UX review of the pre/post session ritual found it collected data (goal, mood, outcome) but never displayed any of it. Changes:
1. **Dead state removed** — `ritualEfficiencyImportance` + setter deleted from `pomodoroSlice.js` (never read anywhere).
2. **Breathing animation rebuilt** (`RitualModal.jsx`) — old 2-phase pulse replaced with: SVG sweep arc (r=108, circumference 678.6) tracing the 8s cycle, 3 concentric ripple rings with staggered delays (0/0.08/0.18s), glowing core (box-shadow blooms on inhale), and dynamic phase text ("Breathe in / Hold / Breathe out") crossfaded by a 50ms JS interval. **Keyframe percentages (35/55/90) must match the `PHASES` array ends** — two sources of truth that sync the visual and the text.
3. **Post-ritual auto-dismiss 10s → 60s** — the real timer lives in `App.jsx` (`confirmPostRitual(null)` timeout). RitualModal shows a visual "Closing in Xs" countdown, and overlay.html's skip countdown was updated 10→60 to match. **Three places must agree: App.jsx timeout, RitualModal postCountdown, overlay.html remaining.**
4. **Goal shown during session** — FocusPage renders `ritualGoal` in a violet-tinted bar while `pomodoroMode === 'work' && pomodoroState === 'work'`.
5. **Outcome dots in StatsPage** — colored dot row (red/amber/violet = Scattered/Focused/Flow) under the Focus Duration chart; only renders if some session has `outcomeRating`.
6. **Sessions table upgraded** — Date+time stacked in first column, new Outcome column, "Show all N sessions" expand/collapse (default 8 rows).
7. **Export is now XLSX, not CSV** — `data:exportCsv` IPC channel (name kept) now writes a styled .xlsx via **exceljs (new prod dependency)**: dark violet header, alternating row fills, focus-score and outcome cells colored by value, frozen header row. Button label says "Export XLSX".
Gotcha discovered: Tailwind opacity suffixes `/6` and `/12` are not in the default scale and get silently dropped by JIT — use `/5` and `/10`.
Note: moodBefore/outcomeRating were ALREADY saved in session objects by `usePomodoro.js` — the gap was display-only.

### 2026-05-22 — Eye tracking bug fixes
Three bugs prevented blinks from being detected at all:
1. **`faceapiRef` null on remount** — `loadModels()` returned early if `modelLoaded` was already true in the store, leaving `faceapiRef.current = null` for freshly mounted hook instances. RAF loop ran forever but `runFrame` exited at the `!faceapi` guard, never detecting anything.
2. **`display:none` video element** — Tailwind `hidden` class sets `display:none`, which blocks Chromium canvas reads from the video element. Changed to off-screen absolute positioning.
3. **Silent error swallowing** — detection errors were caught and discarded; now logged to console to aid diagnosis.
Also lowered face detection score threshold from 0.4 → 0.3 for better detection sensitivity.
Created `filesExplained.txt` in project root — full documentation of every source file.

### 2026-05-22 — Theory-grounded eye tracking overhaul
Synthesized two research papers (Wu & Liu 2022, PMC5742176) into `theoryLogic.md`.
Changes made based on findings:
- **Blink interval variability (CV)** now tracked in `useEyeTracker.js` — last 20 intervals, stored as `blinkVariability` in store
- **Blink Rhythm indicator** added to EyeTracker panel: Regular (CV<0.40) / Variable (0.40–0.70) / Irregular (>0.70)
- **Eye strain thresholds** updated: < 8 BPM = danger (red), 8–12 BPM = caution (amber), based on BRV paper
- **Away threshold default** changed from 3s → 5s — Wu & Liu show ~40% of engaged time is gaze aversion (looking away while thinking is normal)
- **Focus Score** (0–100) computed per session from BPM health (55%) + blink rhythm regularity (45%), saved with sessions
- **Stats page** updated: session table now shows BPM, Rhythm, Focus Score, Away time
**Why:** Raw blink count alone doesn't differentiate cognitive states; interval variability is the real signal (BRV paper).

### 2026-05-22 — Driver navigation fix
Added `data-page` attributes to sidebar `<button>` elements in `Sidebar.jsx`.
Replaced `clickText()` nav calls in `scripts/driver.mjs` with a `navigate(pageId)` helper that uses `[data-page]` selector.
**Why:** lucide-react SVG icons inside buttons caused `textContent` matching to fail silently on System and Docs nav items.

### 2026-05-22 — App fully verified via screenshots
All 4 pages render correctly. System page reads real hardware (i7-1065G7, 31.8GB RAM, Windows). Docs page detects Python 3.14.5 but markitdown not installed. Settings sliders and Save Preferences all functional.

### 2026-05-22 — Persistence layer added
`src/main/persistence.js` — markdown-based persistence to `app.getPath('userData')`:
- `atenttion-sessions.md` — append-only session log
- `atenttion-preferences.md` — YAML frontmatter prefs, read on startup via `data:loadPreferences`

### 2026-05-22 — Settings component added
`src/renderer/src/components/Settings.jsx` — collapsible panel on FocusPage with sliders for all 4 durations + look-away threshold. Preferences loaded on mount in `FocusPage.useEffect`.

### 2026-05-22 — Removed @electron-toolkit packages
Removed `@electron-toolkit/utils` and `@electron-toolkit/preload` entirely.
**Why:** Both packages access `electron.app` at module load time, which throws when `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` is set in the Claude Code shell environment.

### 2026-05-22 — Vite version pinned to ^5.4.11
**Why:** `electron-vite@2.3.0` requires `vite@"^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0"`. Default `npm create electron-vite` was installing vite 6 which caused peer dep failure.

### 2026-05-22 — ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE workaround
Created `scripts/dev.js` which deletes `process.env.ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` before spawning `electron-vite dev`.
`npm run dev` → `node scripts/dev.js` (not `electron-vite dev` directly).
For one-off commands: `$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE = $null` in PowerShell or `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` in bash.

## Known Issues

| # | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GPU cache errors on startup (`Unable to move the cache: Acceso denegado`) | Benign, Windows permission warning, safe to ignore |
| 2 | PowerShell active window detection slow (~2-3s) | By design, polled every 5s |
| 3 | face-api models gitignored, generated by `npm install` | Expected — `scripts/setup-models.js` handles this |
| 4 | `markitdown` requires Python | Graceful degradation — txt/md/html work without it |
